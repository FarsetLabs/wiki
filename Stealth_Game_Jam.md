Stealth Game Jam
----------------

As a warmup to the [Global Game Jam](http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/Global_Game_Jam "Global Game Jam") we have hope to bring you I small taste of jam, stealth flavoured jam.

### What is it?

[Stealth Game Jam](http://sneakybastards.net/stealthjam/) is a bright shiny new global game jammy thing.

The overall theme of the game jam is Stealth.

The jam follows the standard 48 hour and will be taking place on the weekend of 22nd to 24th June 2012.

### Nitty Gritty

Event venue details to come, suffice to say it will be in the Farset Labs in some form.
