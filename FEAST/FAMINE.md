When
----

First Sunday of every month, starting on the 8th July.

Where
-----

You have to ask!?

If we have a small group, we'll host it in the lounge. If a larger group turns up (almost certain - fast food and films tend to attract hackers like a moth to a flame) it will be hosted in the Event Space.

So...food?
----------

Each week we'll muddle around and pick somewhere to put a big order into (making the delivery cost negligible), but feel free to bring your own/order from a different place. Or even not eat(!) and just enjoy the film.

What kind of films are we going for?
------------------------------------

Let's face it, we're going to be sci-fi heavy, but there'll probably be a few curve-balls in there too. TV series aren't out of the question either. You have seen *Firefly*, right?

Drop in suggestions below or talk to David:

### Film suggestions:

  
Hackers - Well, duh. Inaccurate as hell, but everyone wishes they could attend Cyberdelia. And have Angelina Jolie as a girlfriend.

Mission Impossible (pick a number) - Generally solid thrillers. And the tech in the first one brings back memories.

Paycheck - Underrated Philip K Dick adaptation that is highly enjoyable.

Wallander - Swedish detective series. All *sorts* of awesome. Nuanced, intelligent and bitingly realistic in its portrayal of its rich characters. Bloody brilliant.

Before you go, what's with the acronym?
---------------------------------------

Ah. Yeah. That's a very contrived backronym.

**F**ood, **E**ntertainment **a**nd **S**ome **T**hings / **F**ood **a**nd **M**ovie **in** the **E**vent Space.
