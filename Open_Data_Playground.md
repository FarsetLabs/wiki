Open Data Playground
====================

Open Data is the big buzzword of our day. And with connected health and data 
visualisation being similar scale buzzwords, we thought it’d be good to have a 
series of nice relaxed ‘Open Data Playground’ events, where web devs, graphic 
designers, *QL sorcerers, and Data mining enthusiasts can hang out and play 
with bits.

No pressure, just pure unadulterated geekery. Don’t worry if this ‘isn’t your 
area’ or ‘you don’t know where to start’. There will be other geeks there that 
will be able to help. Just ask!
