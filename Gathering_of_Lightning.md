Gathering of Lightning
======================

What?
-----

[Lightning talks] are a great opportunity for people to get up and talk about 
something they are really passionate about without having to go to all the 
effort of writing stuff, organising masses of slides, practising and knowing 
what you are actually talking about; all that boring stuff.

So we want to arrange a day when we can all get together and tell each other 
about stuff we think is really cool.

Where?
------

At Farset Labs, silly.

When?
-----

The next event is on the [2nd of May 2013 at 17:30][1]

Rules of the Game
-----------------

 - Pretty much anything goes for subject matter.
 - Slots will be around 5-10 mins.
 - Short Q&A at the end of each talk is very much encouraged.
 - You can get up more than once
   - But everyone that wants must get up at least once.
 - ~~Extra time may be bought with ice cream~~
