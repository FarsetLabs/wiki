Done well, it can be good publicity for the space. Done badly, it can piss a lot of people off very quickly - a lot of hackspacers aren't too keen on being filmed and our members always come first.

Non-commercial
--------------

If you are filming for non-commercial use, you can do so but you must:

1.  Tell the [Discourse](http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk) *at least* a day in advance.
2.  Don't get in peoples' way, and respect their wishes for privacy.
3.  Don't take up too much space.
4.  Preferably film during off-peak hours (Mon-Friday before 18:00).

Commercial
----------

You must contact [the directors](mailto:admin@farsetlabs.org.uk) for permission at least a week in advance before doing any commercial filming.

Our day rate for commercial filming in the space is Â£300. We may reduce or waive this at our discretion if we like your idea. (We've been known to do news interviews for free in the past.)
