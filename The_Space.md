A busy night in **The Space**, everybody hacking away.

The Hot-Desking Area is currently the main hub of Unit 1. The entrance leads into the Hot-Desking area, The Event Space is accesible from here, as well as The Lounge, The Kitchen and The Toilets.

Currently within the area there are nine spaces available to be used as hot desks, each with power points and networking points. The desks are large and can be easily used by all members to perform any work they wish to do the day they come to the space.

The kitchen has had a new oven installed and has had a few 'necessary' components added, including a communal whiteboard, microwave, toaster, fridge and freezer. The toilets had new toilets installed.

Printing/Scanning facilities
----------------------------

There is a Sharp MFP attached to the open RM One Computer, including drop-in document scanning facilities.

Please feel free to use the printer for small and large print jobs, but please consider a donation to help offset toner and paper costs. In addition, please make sure you leave the printer free of jams and errors when done. Scanning is available to the attached RM One, and the scanned images are available over the network via Windows File Sharing.
