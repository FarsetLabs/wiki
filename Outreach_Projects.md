Outreach Projects
=================

On this page we keep a (mostly) updated list of Outreach projects from the NI
education scene that Farset Labs members may wish to get involved in, for
professional development or just altruistic reasons.

Any Farset Labs member is eligible for free AccessNI check through [W5-STEMNET]
or [Young Enterprise NI], and this check is **not** exclusive to the event or
the collaborator.

CoderDojo
---------

We host a Dojo that is run on the first and third Thursday of the month
(mostly). Please register ahead of attendance as we need to limit numbers based
on our capacity.

 - [Eventbrite Registration Page](http://fsl-dojo.eventbrite.com) - Also is the
   definitive guide to which dates are running

We also maintain a [guide](Resources/Farset_Guide_of_Programming_Guides.md)
aimed at new coders, both young and old!

We also know of the following NI based Dojo's that are in dire need of one-off
or regular mentors

 - [Belfast/BMC](http://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/110)
 - [Newry](http://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/45)
 - [Ballymena](http://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo/274)

If we're missing anything let us know on outreach@farsetlabs.org.uk

### What is a Coder Dojo

CoderDojo is a movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding
clubs and regular sessions for young people.

At a CoderDojo, young people learn how to code, develop websites, apps,
programs, games and more. Dojos are set up, run by and taught at by volunteers.
In addition to learning to code, members meet like minded people, show off what
they’ve been working on and so on. CoderDojo makes development and learning to
code a fun, sociable, kick ass experience.

CoderDojo also puts a strong emphasis on open source and free software, and has
a strong network of members and volunteers globally. CoderDojo has just one
rule: “Above All: Be Cool“, bullying, lying, wasting peoples time and so on is
uncool.

It also provides essential teaching and mentorship experience for budding
software developers; after all, to teach is to learn twice! And you don't have
to be a hardcore code-hacker to mentor; anyone can help to guide these kids
through the processes of problem solving, breaking down tasks, thinking in a
stepwise fashion, or just picking out the killer-spelling-mistakes like
variable names or missing semi-colons!
