At Farset Labs, we make every effort to engage with technologists of all background and all ages. However we realise that there are some practicalities when it comes to dealing with under 18's.

The Short Answer
================

By default, Farset Labs operates as a 18+ space, with exceptions made for parents with children and 16-17 year olds before 8pm, as long as there are at least two members in the space with them and they are not left unattended. Members are not obligated to chaperone children around the space.

Basically, general common sense rules for mentors or anyone attending an event that includes under 18's ([CoderDojo](http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/Outreach_Projects#CoderDojo "Outreach Projects"))

-   0. Never be alone with a child
-   1. If you see someone alone with a child, go there.
-   2. If you see someone you do not know, ask whoever is running the event if they know them, and then ask them to leave if they are not a parent or mentor.

More Legal Answer
=================

Farset Labs operates within the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (SVG) Act 2006 and the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (Northern Ireland) Order 2007, both as amended in particular by, respectively, section 64 and Schedule 7, Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.[[1]](http://www.dhsspsni.gov.uk/regulated-activity-children.pdf)

We insist on under 14s being attended by their parents, and there must be at least two registered mentors in the room at all times throughout Underage events

At the lead mentors' discretion, the event space may be sealed off from the rest of the space, during which time members will not be allowed to enter the space, and parents are expected to escort their children to and from the toilets. This will usually be in the case where there is another public event operating in the Labs at the same time or the co-working space is in high levels of use.
