Waste
=====

The space has a rudimentary sorting system for waste to help both keep the
bills down, but more importantly, avoid landfilling recyclables. When you're in
the building and binning waste, please remove all the recyclables first.

Landfill Waste
--------------

Please use the black plastic bins around the space for mixed waste and food
matter. When the small plastic bins are full, please empty the bag into the red
Biffa bin in the workshop and replace the bin bag. Black bin bags can be found
in the kitchen.

### Bin Collections

The red Biffa bin is collected on Monday mornings, so if you are in the space
on a Sunday, please make sure it's left outside by the front door, and bring it
back in on Monday.

Recycling
---------

Weavers Court has provisions for recycling all dry recyclables except glass.
There are several large green 1200 litre recycling bins kept behind Unit 5, on
the road leading to the back of the park.

Please put all recyclables in the recycling bins in the kitchen, under the
worktop. Separating is appreciated. When a box is full, please empty it in the
large bins in the business park.

**Do not put glass in the Weavers Court bins!**

To get to the recycling bins, go out the front door, and turn right, crossing
the car park. Use the gap in the fence at the end of the car park and turn
left, and the green bins should immediately be on your left.

### Recycling Glass

Glass can't be processed at Weavers Court, but there are plenty of
[Glass Bottle Banks](http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/recycling/bottlebanks.asp)
in Belfast. If you're feeling generous, when the box in the kitchen is full,
feel free to empty it to any bottle bank.
