### Electrics

The electric supply for the space is a 3-phase standard mains type supplied by
Northern Ireland Electricity on the Commercial tariff. The main inlet breaker
panel is at ceiling level on the far end of the office space.

### Heating

The heating system in the space is a gas-fired combi-boiler that provides both
central heating and hot water on demand.

The preset times for central heating are as follows (7 days a week):

 - **08:30-10:30**
 - **13:00-14:30**
 - **18:00-21:00**

If you are cold or staying late, feel free to turn on the heating for the
duration of your stay. The best way to do this is to use the *Boost* button on
the control panel to the lower right of the boiler.

You know the heating is on when the red "Heat On" LED is lit.

If you don't know what button to push, don't push any!

#### Boiler

The boiler for the building is located at the back of the event space through a
door, mounted against the outer wall. Gas isolator and mains water inlet valves
are mounted under the unit.

The main control unit is mounted to the right of the boiler. The four settings
it permits are as follows:

 - **Auto:** activated at the specified times above
 - **All Day:** 08:00 - 23:59
 - **24 hours:** 24 hours a day
 - **Off:** Disabled

In addition, the *BOOST* button forces the system to be on for an hour on
demand, useful if people are staying late at night or at unusual hours.

The temperature control on the left side controls the central heating system.
A comfortable temperature is around the 2 o'clock position. The building will
reach this temperature around 10 minutes after the heating is turned on.

### Fire System

The fire system is an RES-installed type centralised at Weavers Court security.
A test is conducted for 5 seconds every Monday at 1630GMT.
