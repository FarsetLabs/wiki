The Ultimaker is a fantastic piece of hardware for the space that was paid for
by [community crowdfunding](http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer)
and as such should be treated with more-than-the-usual amount of respect.

Costs
=====

While members are encouraged to use it to experiment, any large or commercial
uses should be compensated for.

Normal Members Usage costs
--------------------------

The below costs are approximated to include a small fundraising amount above
cost-price to make the printer sustainable in the long run

||
|------|----|
|Filament|5p/g|
|Electricity|10p/hr|

Off-plan costs
--------------

When the ultimaker is being let out for an event or for non-members use in the
space, the consensus is to charge **Â£5/30mins** of print time.

Use
===

Modelling
---------

The usual suspects for model design:

 - [Solidworks] (Not availiable in the space)
 - [Sketchup] (Free to download/use)

Slicing
-------

Slicing is the process of taking a model file (usually [STL]) and turning it
into a [GCODE] toolpath that the Ultimaker can accept either directly from an
attached computer or via an SD card inserted into the [Ulticontroller]
on the machine.

 - [Cura] (Most popular in the space and in the general Ultimaker community)
 - [Slic3r] (Also quite common in the space, a barebones [Skeinforge] GUI)
 - Many others are available, Google Is Your Friend
