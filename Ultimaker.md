The Ultimaker is a fantastic piece of hardware for the space that was paid for by [community crowdfunding](http://www.sponsume.com/project/farset-labs-3d-printer) and as such should be treated with more-than-the-usual amount of respect.

Costs
=====

While members are encouraged to use it to experiment, any large or commercial uses should be compensated for.

Normal Members Usage costs
--------------------------

The below costs are approximated to include a small fundraising amount above cost-price to make the printer sustainable in the long run

|Aspect|Cost|
|:-----|:---|
|Filament|5p/g|
|Electricity|10p/hr|

Off-plan costs
--------------

When the ultimaker is being let out for an event or for non-members use in the space, the consensus is to charge **Â£5/30mins** of print time.

Use

Modelling
---------

The usual suspects for model design:

-   [Solidworks](http://www.solidworks.co.uk/) (Not availiable in the space)
-   [Sketchup](http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/product/gsu.html) (Free to download/use)

Slicing
-------

Slicing is the process of taking a model file (usually [STL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format))) and turning it into a [GCODE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gcode) toolpath that the Ultimaker can accept either directly from an attached computer or via an SD card inserted into the [Ulticontroller](https://shop.ultimaker.com/en/parts-and-upgrades/ulticontroller-ultipanel.html) on the machine.

-   [Cura](http://wiki.ultimaker.com/Cura) (Most popular in the space and in the general Ultimaker community)
-   [Slic3r](http://slic3r.org/) (Also quite common in the space, a barebones [Skeinforge](http://fabmetheus.crsndoo.com/) GUI)
