Raspberry Jam is a semi-regular series of events that make for a great environment for beginners, experimenters, and experts to learn and share their experiences and ideas with the [RaspberryPi](http://raspberrypi.org) platform.

The Gist
========

While these, like pretty much every other Farset event, is a bit of lightly constrained chaos... and every one is different.

The general format is based around a range of activities:

Presenter led, Hands-on Tutorials  
One (or more) of the community leads a walk through of a particular aspect or use of the RPi. These can be specific to the Pi, such as GPIO access, or can be general computing running on the Pi, such as PyGame or Scratch.

Show and Tell / Demo time  
Open season from the community about whatever weird and wonderful projects they've been working on, or been having trouble with. This is usually the longest section of the event...

On-demand hack-time  
We always try to make sure that there are a few saavy floating helpers from the Farset Community who kindly give even more of their time than usual to help out anyone who's having problems or whats some more in-depth help (These are often very congested so please don't be annoyed if we don't get to you immediately! We try our best!)
