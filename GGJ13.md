Global Game Jam 2013
====================

Organiser: Andrew Bolster

General Info: [Global Game Jam]

Alternative Event in [Coleraine] - **Students only**

[Jan 25-27 2013][site-page]:[EventBrite] (Registration is **required** for
attendance)

Theme
-----

The Theme is **To Be Announced** but we've been told it'll be general enough 
for no-one to be excluded. **WHEN THE THEME IS ANNOUNCED, DO NOT ANNOUNCE IT 
TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD**, we have to wait until 0300 on Saturday morning for 
Hawaii to be told at **their** 1700. Super secret agent times indeed...

Diversifiers
------------

The GGJ Diversifier system is a system aimed at diversifying the games as 
well as providing motivation for experienced game jammers. In a sense, the 
diversifiers are a free-for-all voluntary list of secondary constraints, that 
the individual teams can choose to go for, or not, as they please. If they do 
go for one or more diversifiers, they get to tick off those diversifiers as 
fulfilled when uploading their game. As stated above, the diversifiers are 
absolutely voluntary, and no points are given for taking them. If you are a 
first time team of students, we recommend that you focus primarily on the 
overall constraint, and only add in extra diversifiers if you feel sure you 
will have something to hand in on Sunday.

#### Stay Inside The Box  
The whole game takes place in just one screen, no scrolling or changing 
screens in any way is allowed.

#### True Colors  
The game uses only the basic 16 colors: black, gray, silver, white, maroon, 
red, olive, yellow, green, lime, teal, aqua, navy, blue, purple and fuchsia.

#### Atari Age  
The game must be, at a maximum, 4Kb in size.

#### I Know What You Did Last Summer  
Game world is persistent between sessions and changes from one session affect 
game play on the following ones.

#### Backwards  
One or more aspects of the game works the opposite as would normally be 
expected: maybe the controller is reversed (left is right, right is left), 
maybe you win lives every time you die, maybe it scrolls to the left and your 
character moonwalks.

#### I’m Board  
Make a game that is inspired by, but not a simulation of, a popular board 
game.

#### The Truth is Out There  
Some external real world element, such as weather, time of the day, etc, 
affects gameplay. It MUST affect gameplay and can’t be only a scenario 
element.

#### No cheating (please)  
The game system relies on willing player participation to enforce the rules 
of the game world (e.g., hold your breath, close your eyes, etc.).

#### More the Merrier  
The game is a competitive or cooperative multiplayer "party game" (i.e., 
based on minigames, humor, 4+ players, audience engagement, etc.), meant for 
one screen or more.

#### 10 little pigs  
The game uses 10 or more buttons or keys for gameplay-related actions (no 
pause or anything else).

#### Two Are Better Than One  
The game requires two or more different mobile devices to play.

#### Approved for All Audiences  
The game must not show any violence, not even cartoonish. Stepping on living 
mushrooms is off the list, as is killing any type of enemies, not even
undead, though we know they’re already dead…

#### Inclusive  
The game is specifically designed to include people with a given disability.

#### X Marks the Spot  
The game involves something location-based, such as a geocache, or requires 
the player to go to one or more specific geographic locations.

### Sponsored Diversifiers

#### Bigger Picture  
The game touches on a political, environmental or social issue.

#### May the (Web) Force Be with You  
The game runs in a browser with no plugin.

Keynote
-------

The Keynotes this year are [Erin Robinson], award winning indie game designer 
and [Bret Victor], inventor & designer of experimental UI concepts at Apple.

They'll be live-streamed to the space and the lounge.

Prizes
------

[GitHub] are giving $70 of GH Credit to every location across the world as a 
prize to be given at the organizers disgression. We'll be doing it as fairly 
as we know how; Tallymarks on the Blackboard at the end of the final 
presentations.

   these yet...][1])
 - Power Strip
 - Notepads (We'll have some scribble boards but bring some just to be sure)
 - Money! The event isn't *fully* catered so we'll be supplying as much food

 - BYO Drinks, unless you're happy with 1 beer for the full weekend!
 - (if you plan on staying overnight) Deoderant / Washbag / Change of Clothes 
   / Sleeping bag
   - Also, while there ARE shower facilities in the business park, I wouldn't

Many thanks to the University of Ulster's Office of Innovation for sponsoring 
this event; they're providing:

There will be other snacks and drinks around the space, but attendees are
