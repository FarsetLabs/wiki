The HSL (Hackerspace License) is a draft code for licensing donations to hackerspaces, much like Creative Commons for software and content. It allows members of hackerspaces, or people outside the organisations to donate equipment to the community pool with or without restrictions on its use. Farset Labs has noticed that a lot of people are unwilling to donate things if it assumed anything can be done with it.
