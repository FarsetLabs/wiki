Purpose
=======

The Purpose of this page is to codify the 'gotchas' that we've experienced in running events, and as a way for Farset Labs to keep consistency in it's events.

These are merely suggestions, and the need for these varies depending on the scale, urgency, popularity, and technical content of an event. However, these are the closest to 'rules of thumb' that we can come up with.

PR Timeline
===========

T-1 mth
-------

If the event is a regular monthly event, then simply remind any attendees that it's regular, and hopefully they'll come back!

For larger, one off, events, this is the perfect time to negotiate any sponsorships required for the next event, as well as securing any speakers required, and if any 'crazy' equipment is needed, letting the directors know (They're helpful guys)

T-3 wks
-------

At this point, you should know what you're actually talking about. Hopefully. Maybe. Anyway.

Start things internally; it's always good to get feedback from the community before you go crazy with PR, so set up (or ask one of the directors to set up) a Facebook event and post it in the [group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/belfast.makerspace/) / [page](https://www.facebook.com/FarsetLabs). This lets you settle on the date without having to faff around with a dozen event sites.

Ask the directors to put the event on the [Farset Labs event calendar](http://unit1.farsetlabs.org.uk/wiki/index.php/Farset_Labs:Current_events)

T-2 wks
-------

Now the push; The date has been settled for a week now, if anyone wants to change it, well they should have paid better attention, shouldn't they?

Depending on how interesting the event is, if you submit a draft blog-post to the directors, they'll be able to proof and post it through the main blog. This is then automatically shared with the main twitter and facebook presences of the space **but is not automatically put on the Farset Labs Calendar** (see above)

Once the post is out, post the event (with each event posting linking back to the original blog post) to the following sites (If it's an internal, member-driven event, don't bother; we don't want any riff raff :P)

-   [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/org/2238451237)
-   [Digital Circle](http://www.digitalcircle.org/events/)
-   [SyncNI](http://syncni.com/companies/c.php?id=437)
