Every Wednesday, Farset Labs opens it's event space for free to local technology user groups to meet and experiment.

If you have an idea for a User Group for a technology you can't live without (or just want to know more about) or if you are already part of a user group and want to book a slot, get in touch with [Bolster](User:Bolster "wikilink")
