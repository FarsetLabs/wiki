Boarduino Build-off
===================

Gist
----

 - 30 people start with a bag of components and walk out with a computer more
   powerful than the machines that put man on the moon.
 - Get experience in practical physical electronics right through to
   programming their first embedded applications.

Required
--------

 - Boarduino [kits] (450 for 30 + shipping)
 - FTDI [adaptors]
 - Soldering Irons (From experience, this works for groups, so even groups of
   3/4 work, so say we need 10)

Funding Options
---------------

### Self Fund
Assuming appropriate interest, the cost of the boards can be recouped by an
event fee. That justifies people taking *their* arduino home.

This still leaves us with inevitable (or is it?) catering etc.

### Sponsored Event?
 - Schrader?

If we go for a sponsored event, its possible we could get a pile of (only need
8 or so) FTDI cables to keep in the space, as well as soldering irons, which
are always good.

Organisation
------------

 - [EventBrite] - Currently Directors only.
