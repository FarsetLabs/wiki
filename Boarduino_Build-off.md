Gist
====

-   30 people start with a bag of components and walk out with a computer more powerful than the machines that put man on the moon.
-   Get experience in practical physical electronics right through to programming their first embedded applications

Required
========

-   Boarduino [Kits](http://www.oomlout.co.uk/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=234) (450 for 30 + shipping)
-   FTDI [adaptors](http://www.oomlout.co.uk/usb-serial-cable-33v-p-232.html)
-   Soldering Irons (From experience, this works for groups, so even groups of 3/4 work, so say we need 10)

Funding Options
===============

Self Fund
---------

Assuming appropriate interest, the cost of the boards can be recouped by an event fee. That justifies people taking 'their' arduino home.

This still leaves us with inevitable (or is it?) catering etc.

Sponsored Event?
----------------

-   Schrader?

If we go for a sponsored event, its possible we could get a pile of (only need 8 or so) FTDI cables to keep in the space, as well as soldering irons, which are always good.

Organisation
============

-   [EventBrite](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/edit?msg=1&saved=1&eid=3443444435) - Currently Directors only.
