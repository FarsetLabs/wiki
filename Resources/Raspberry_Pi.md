Suggested Resources
===================

While we are happy enough to help people get started, there are a wealth of materials online to guide you through the early stages of Pi-ownership.

-   [RPi Quick Start Guide](http://www.raspberrypi.org/quick-start-guide) - An introduction to the Hardware on the Pi, how to install an image to your pi, and how to get into a nearly-recognisable desktop to being playing
-   [Adafruit Learning System](http://learn.adafruit.com/category/raspberry-pi) - The most fantastic and in-depth Raspberry Pi resource for electronics fans, by the amazing [LadyAda](http://www.ladyada.net/)
-   [Get Started with Scratch](http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Support/Get_Started) - Visual Programming for all ages; as simple as lego and with much more motion. (Skip steps 1 and 2 if you already have the Scratch logo on your Pi's Desktop, as is the case of Raspbian installs)
