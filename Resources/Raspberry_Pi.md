Suggested Resources
===================

While we are happy enough to help people get started, there are a wealth of
materials online to guide you through the early stages of Pi-ownership.

 - [RPi Quick Start Guide] - An introduction to the Hardware on the Pi, how to
   install an image to your pi, and how to get into a nearly-recognisable
   desktop to being playing
 - [Adafruit Learning System] - The most fantastic and in-depth Raspberry Pi
   resource for electronics fans, by the amazing
   [LadyAda](http://www.ladyada.net/)
 - [Get Started with Scratch] - Visual Programming for all ages; as simple as
   lego and with much more motion. (Skip steps 1 and 2 if you already have the
   Scratch logo on your Pi's Desktop, as is the case of Raspbian installs)

In-House Resources
------------------

Over time we're developing a library of short guides for the pi (mostly adapted
from other sources or from pure experience)

 - [Idiots Guide to putting an Image on your Pi](Idiots_Guide_to_putting_an_Image_on_your_Pi.md "wikilink")
 - [Hello Pi](Hello_Pi.md "wikilink") from Python (and later a range of other languages)
 - [LEDBorg](LEDBorg.md "wikilink") - How to use the fantastic [GPIO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Purpose_Input/Output) LED board by [PiBorg](http://piborg.org)
 - [RPMC](RPMC.md "wikilink") - [XBMC](http://xbmc.org/) Media Centre on the Raspberry Pi
 - [AdvanceMAME](AdvanceMAME.md "wikilink") - Play thousands of retro video games on your Pi
