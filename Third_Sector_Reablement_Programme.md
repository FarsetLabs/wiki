In May 2013, Farset Labs, UUJ, and a network of Community and Voluntary Care stakeholders embarked on a programme of events focused on identifying and prototyping reablement assistance technologies.

~May 20th 2013: 9:30-13:30; Farset Labs

Introduction
------------

The purpose of the event was to provide an open platform for idea generation around the opportunities for reablement services to be supported by new technologies and new ways of thinking.

At the event we hoped to arrive at a consensus on the challenges that need to be to be addressed, rather than producing many 'weak' solutions.

With so many stakeholders and technical advisors, there is a need for a facilitated discussion around the sectoral problems before any problem statement could be accurately derived.

### Event Format

1.  Cross stakeholder brainstorming / 'ice-breaking' session, to look at the per-stakeholder experiences and the problems within and between organisations that would fall under the scope of the project. These problems would then be returned to the group and summarised into a few problem groups.
2.  Self-organised group discussions, the intention being for problem-groupings to naturally emerge from the brainstorming sessions, and for these groups to collectively discuss the specifics of a problem domain.
3.  Finally, a round up section took the selection of problems that are 'still ctanding', and through an open-channel discussion arrived at a number of opportunities with which we can go forward.
