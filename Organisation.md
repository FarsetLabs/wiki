Code of Conduct
---------------

The currently enacted form of the Code of Conduct is on the [Blog][coc].
There is also an [abridged version][coc-abridged] but it is not guaranteed to
be legally identical to the full legalese text.

There is also a wiki-version of the [Code of Conduct][coc-wiki] that includes
the latest proposed changes. This is not currently enacted until it is updated
on the blog after unanimous director approval and community consultation,
including but not limited to this wiki, the [Town Hall](Town_Hall.md) meetings,
or other ad-hoc community conversations. The community will always be notified
of changes before publication.

Various Legislation etc
-----------------------

 - As a NFP we are [exempt from certain sections of the DPA'98][1],
   specifically processing which is only for the purporses of:
   - establishing or maintaining membership;
   - providing or administering activities for either the members or those who
     have regular contact with it
- A list of members names will be available to any other member. We may need to
  provide the [members list][2] to a member or non-member if requested for a
  [suitable purpose][3], but we'd probably ask a lawyer or court to advise on
  [whether the purpose is suitable or not][4].
