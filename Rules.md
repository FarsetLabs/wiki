Rules
=====

Farset Labs is run entirely by its members and, on the whole, this works pretty
well. As hackers we hate making rules almost as much as we hate following them,
so we really want to keep the number of rules to a minimum. We can only do this
if members and visitors observe the spirit -- not just the letter -- of these
rules; they are here firstly for your safety, and secondly to prevent annoyance
to other users of the space.

For a more comprehensive (Legalese) breakdown of the rules, see the
[Code Of Conduct](Code_of_Conduct/Full_Text.md)

One prominent hackerspace has only one rule: "Be excellent to each other." It's
a good rule, but they have quite a lot of drama, and we've found that a few
good rules can help reduce the drama.

We also have a number of [guides](Policies_and_Guides.md) that are good reading
for prospective users of the space. This includes our policy on
[filming](Film_and_Photography_Policy.md).

Rule Zero
---------

 0. Do not be on fire.

Safety
------

 1. Don't use tools unless you're sure you know how to do so safely. If you see
    someone working in an unsafe way, it's your duty to stop them and let them
    know.
 2. Don't defeat or hack safety features/equipment. This is for other people's
    safety as much as yours.
 3. Check the wiki for instructions. If there are no instructions and you think
    you can write them, [write them][Policies_and_Guides.md]. If in doubt, ask.

Making Decisions
----------------

 4. If something is broken, fix it; don't complain. If you can't fix it, tell
    [the directors](Organisation.md) ASAP.
 5. If you're doing something major, ask the mailing list first.

Etiquette
---------

 6. Do not treat the Hackspace like your home, it is a shared space. Sleeping
    anywhere on Hackspace property is forbidden.
    ([more info](Sleeping_in_Hackspace.md))

Personal Items
--------------

 7. Members are allowed to store personal items in the space, but they must be
    kept in one of the plastic boxes, labelled with your name. One box per
    member. Empty boxes may be recycled for other members if needed.
 8. Larger/more items may be allowed, but please note that space is limited.
    You **must** give a shout on the
    [Discourse](http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk) first, and items should be
    clearly labelled as yours, and with the date they will be removed by.

Donating, Loaning, or Borrowing Items
-------------------------------------

 9. [Carefully consider](Guides/Bringing_items_to_the_space.md) the true
    usefulness of an item before bringing it to the space. Disposal requires
    effort and space is limited. Seek permission for large items.
 10. If you're leaving something and you would rather it was not mercilessly
     ripped apart, please label it accordingly.
 11. Likewise, if something looks expensive or useful please don't mercilessly
     rip it apart without asking first.
 12. Don't remove tools from the space without asking the mailing list first.

Tidiness
--------

 13. Workbenches should be completely clean when you leave - be considerate for
     the next user. Please put tools back where you found them.
 14. Put your dirty cups and plates in the dishwasher before leaving the space.
     Don't leave them in the sink.
 15. Any items left on a workbench overnight become fair game. Put your stuff
     back in your box.
 16. If you have engaged in any waste generating activity (e.g. peeling wires),
     hoover the spot.
 17. Please do not bring bikes into the space unless you are working on them,
     they take up too much room.

Disposal
--------

 18. If you think something should be thrown out, put it in the outgoing trash
     box. Two weeks later the box will go in the skip.
 19. If something is too big to fit in the trash box, you should probably post
     to the list about it.
 20. If you want to throw something away which looks useful, make sure the
     mailing list is informed well in advance.

Penalties
---------

If you continually annoy or endanger others by ignoring these rules, the
[trustees](Organisation/Trustees.md) have the right to impose sanctions, as
described in the [Grievance Procedure](Grievance_Procedure.md). It is not
something they want to do.
