Farset Labs is run entirely by its members and, on the whole, this works pretty well. As hackers we hate making rules almost as much as we hate following them, so we really want to keep the number of rules to a minimum. We can only do this if members and visitors observe the spirit -- not just the letter -- of these rules; they are here firstly for your safety, and secondly to prevent annoyance to other users of the space.

For a more comprehensive (Legalese) breakdown of the rules, see the [Code Of Conduct](http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/Code_of_Conduct/Full_Text "Code of Conduct/Full Text")

One prominent hackerspace has only one rule: "Be excellent to each other." It's a good rule, but they have quite a lot of drama, and we've found that a few good rules can help reduce the drama.

We also have a number of [guides](http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/Policies_and_Guides "Policies and Guides") that are good reading for prospective users of the space. This includes our policy on [filming](http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/Film_and_Photography_Policy "Film and Photography Policy").

Rule Zero
---------

1.  Do not be on fire.

Safety
------

1.  Don't use tools unless you're sure you know how to do so safely. If you see someone working in an unsafe way, it's your duty to stop them and let them know.
2.  Don't defeat or hack safety features/equipment. This is for other people's safety as much as yours.
3.  Check the wiki for instructions. If there are no instructions and you think you can write them, [Policies and Guides|write them]. If in doubt, ask.

Making Decisions
----------------

1.  If something is broken, fix it; don't complain. If you can't fix it, tell [the directors](http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/Organisation "Organisation") ASAP.
2.  If you're doing something major, ask the mailing list first.

Etiquette
---------

1.  Do not treat the Hackspace like your home, it is a shared space. Sleeping anywhere on Hackspace property is forbidden. ([More info](http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/Sleeping_in_Hackspace "Sleeping in Hackspace"))

Personal Items
--------------

1.  Members are allowed to store personal items in the space, but they must be kept in one of the plastic boxes, labelled with your name. One box per member. Empty boxes may be recycled for other members if needed.
2.  Larger/more items may be allowed, but please note that space is limited. You **must** give a shout on the [[Discourse](http://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk)] first, and items should be clearly labelled as yours, and with the date they will be removed by.

Donating, Loaning, or Borrowing Items
-------------------------------------

1.  [Carefully consider](http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/w/index.php?title=Guides/Bringing_items_to_the_space&action=edit&redlink=1 "Guides/Bringing items to the space (page does not exist)") the true usefulness of an item before bringing it to the space. Disposal requires effort and space is limited. Seek permission for large items.
2.  If you're leaving something and you would rather it was not mercilessly ripped apart, please label it accordingly.
3.  Likewise, if something looks expensive or useful please don't mercilessly rip it apart without asking first.
4.  Don't remove tools from the space without asking the mailing list first.

Tidiness
--------

1.  Workbenches should be completely clean when you leave - be considerate for the next user. Please put tools back where you found them.
2.  Put your dirty cups and plates in the dishwasher before leaving the space. Don't leave them in the sink.
3.  Any items left on a workbench overnight become fair game. Put your stuff back in your box.
4.  If you have engaged in any waste generating activity (e.g. peeling wires), hoover the spot.
5.  Please do not bring bikes into the space unless you are working on them, they take up too much room.

Disposal
--------

1.  If you think something should be thrown out, put it in the outgoing trash box. Two weeks later the box will go in the skip.
2.  If something is too big to fit in the trash box, you should probably post to the list about it.
3.  If you want to throw something away which looks useful, make sure the mailing list is informed well in advance.

Penalties
---------

If you continually annoy or endanger others by ignoring these rules, the [trustees](http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/w/index.php?title=Organisation/Trustees&action=edit&redlink=1 "Organisation/Trustees (page does not exist)") have the right to impose sanctions, as described in the [Grievance Procedure](http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/w/index.php?title=Grievance_Procedure&action=edit&redlink=1 "Grievance Procedure (page does not exist)"). It is not something they want to do.
